# HowManyDays
This is the repository of the pyhton code for the website HowManyDays.
HowManyDays was my first functional website; it used advanced mathematical algorithms to count days - skipping weekends and holidays; which could have been useful for lawyers, businessmen, programmers, etc.
It helped you track your time just a little bit better.

The code is free to use; it is written based on Spanish holidays (where I lived at the time). However, little modification is needed in order to use it with any other country's holidays. The code is quite intuitive. 

The file is written for a flask website. You will find the code to skip days in the functions declared in the file. Feel free to adapt ir to your needs.

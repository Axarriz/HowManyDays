# HowManyDays
This is the repository of the pyhton code for the website HowManyDays
HowManyDays was my first functional website; it used advanced mathematical algorithms to count days, skipping weekends and holidays; which could have been useful for lawyers, businessmen, programmers, etc.
It helped you track your time just a little bit better.

The code is free to use; it is written based on Spanish holidays (where I'm based). However, little modification is needed in order to use it with any other country's holidays. The code is quite intuitive. 

The file is written for a flask website. You will find the code to skip days in the functions declared in the file.

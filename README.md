# HowManyDays
This is the repository of the pyhton code for the website HowManyDays
HowManyDays was my first functional website; it used advanced algorithms to count days, skipping weekends and holidays, which could have been useful for lawyers, businessmen, programmers...
It helped you to track your time just a little bit better

The code is free to use; it is written based on Spanish holidays (where I'm from). However, little modification is needed in order to use it with any other country's holidays. As I see it, the code is quite intuitive.
